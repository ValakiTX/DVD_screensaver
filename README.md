First, you need to install the Processing software for your device (newest version) (copy this link: https://processing.org/download/ ),
and downloat the DVD.jpg (Don't rename it!!!).
Then run it, paste my code there, go to the "Sketch" tab, press "Add File..." inport DVD.jpg, then save your work somewhere.
Open your saved project, go to "File" tab, press "Export Application..." chose the right Operation System, go to the program's file folder,
go into the application's folder, and open it from there. If you did everything right, it will work.
